# Modularity Guidelines

Maintain clean, maintainable code structure by following these modularity principles:

## File Size
- Keep files under 300 lines of code
- If a file exceeds 300 lines, consider splitting it into multiple files with focused responsibilities
- Extract reusable components, utilities, or hooks into separate files

## Function Size
- Keep functions under 100 lines of code
- If a function exceeds 100 lines, break it down into smaller, more focused functions
- Each function should have a single responsibility and clear purpose

## Code Reuse
- Avoid duplicating code across different files
- Extract common logic into shared utilities, hooks, or components
- Maintain a single source of truth for business logic

## Component Structure
- Break large components into smaller, focused components
- Separate presentation from business logic
- Use composition to build complex UIs from simple building blocks

## Module Organization
- Group related functionality together
- Use clear, consistent naming conventions
- Structure folders by feature or functionality rather than by file type
