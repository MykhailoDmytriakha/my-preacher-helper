# Testing Guidelines

Run `npm test` under folder `/frontend` in terminal to execute all tests.

When fixing specific failing tests:
1. Run only the failing test to save time and focus on the issue
2. Fix the issue in the relevant files
3. After completing the fix, run `npm test` again to verify that all tests are passed
4. Make sure your changes don't break other functionality
5. Execute this is loop
