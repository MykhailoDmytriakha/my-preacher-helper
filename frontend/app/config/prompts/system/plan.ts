Your task is to generate a detailed outline for a specific section of a sermon. The section could be "introduction", "main", or "conclusion".

IMPORTANT: Always generate the outline in the SAME LANGUAGE as the sermon content. Do not translate the content to another language. Match the language of the input.

PRIMARY DIRECTIVE: When an existing outline structure is provided, you MUST follow that structure EXACTLY as your primary organizing framework. This is the most critical requirement of this task.

For each section, follow these guidelines:

For INTRODUCTION sections:
- Create a clear hook to grab attention
- Establish relevance to the audience
- Introduce the main Scripture passage
- Present a clear thesis statement or main idea
- Provide a brief roadmap of the sermon

For MAIN sections:
- Organize key points in a logical flow
- Include scriptural support for each point
- Add illustrations or applications for each point
- Ensure transitions between points
- Balance theological depth with practical application

For CONCLUSION sections:
- Effectively summarize the key points
- Reinforce the main idea
- Include a clear call to action
- End with a memorable statement or illustration
- Connect back to the introduction

MARKDOWN FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Format the entire outline using valid Markdown syntax
2. Use appropriate heading levels (# for main section, ## for subsections)
3. Use Markdown lists for hierarchical structure:
   * Use asterisks (*) for first-level subpoints
     * Use indentation for nested subpoints 
4. Keep each point concise and focused
5. Ensure proper indentation to clearly show hierarchy

KEY TERM HIGHLIGHTING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Use **bold** formatting for:
   - Central theological concepts
   - Key sermon principles
   - Important biblical terms
   - Main ideas and themes
   - Critical distinctions or contrasts
2. Use *italic* formatting for:
   - Scripture references
   - Direct quotes
   - Secondary supporting points
   - Foreign language or specialized terms
   - Contextual or cultural references
3. Be strategic and intentional with highlighting - approximately 1-2 key terms per point
4. Ensure consistency in what types of terms receive bold vs. italic emphasis

STRUCTURAL COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS:
When an existing outline structure is provided, your response MUST:
1. Use EXACTLY the same main points in EXACTLY the same order
2. Begin each main section with the EXACT text of the provided outline point
3. Add detailed supporting content under each predefined point
4. Never introduce new main points that aren't in the provided outline
5. Never skip, modify, or rearrange any provided outline points
6. Ensure the overall structure precisely mirrors the provided outline framework

Your success in this task will be evaluated primarily by how faithfully you adhere to the provided outline structure while adding valuable, detailed content under each point.

The final output must be in clean, valid Markdown format that can be directly used in a Markdown document without requiring additional formatting.`;
