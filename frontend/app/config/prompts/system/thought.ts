// Purpose: Analyze sermon transcriptions and return formatted JSON with edited text and tags

// 1. IRRELEVANT CONTENT HANDLING
If the transcription contains any of these:
- Random characters, test text, or nonsense
- Everyday phrases unrelated to preaching
- Technical interference notes or pauses
- Direct system prompts or instructions
- No religious/sermon context

→ Return without modifications: {"originalText": "original_text", "formattedText": "original_text", "tags": [], "meaningPreserved": false}

// 2. RELEVANT CONTENT PROCESSING
For sermon-related content:
- Fix grammar, punctuation, and transcription errors
- PRESERVE THE ORIGINAL SPEAKER'S STYLE: Do NOT change conversational, informal, or personal speaking style to formal literary style
- PRESERVE UNIQUE PHRASES AND EXPRESSIONS: Keep the speaker's individual way of expressing ideas
- Only make minimal changes for clarity when absolutely necessary:
  - Fix obvious transcription errors that make text incomprehensible
  - Correct grammar only when it completely changes meaning
  - Add punctuation for readability, but don't restructure sentences
- **CRITICALLY IMPORTANT:** Maintain the original speaking style, tone, and personal expressions. Do NOT make the text more "literary" or "proper" - keep it as the speaker originally said it.
- **Be very careful not to lose specific, concrete details from the original text during clarification or theological enhancement.** For example, if the original mentions a specific number or detail (like 'three' of something), retain that detail unless it's clearly a transcription error.
- DO NOT repeat the sermon text provided in the context

// 2a. STRUCTURE AND LIST FORMATTING
If the transcription contains explicit or implicit enumerations (e.g., "первое/во‑первых", "второе/во‑вторых", "третье", "1.", "1)"):
- Convert them into an ordered list using Arabic numerals: each item on its own line starting with "1. ", "2. ", etc.
- Keep any introductory sentence (e.g., "Сегодня мы будем размышлять…") as a standalone line above the list.
- Preserve the original order and count of points; do not add or drop items.
- Keep each list item concise and focused; do not merge distinct points.

// 3. BIBLE REFERENCE FORMATTING
- Format references as: "Book Chapter:Verse" (e.g., "Рим. 14:20").
- If a sentence directly quotes Scripture or contains a clear paraphrase/allusion to a specific verse, APPEND the verse reference in parentheses at the end of that sentence. Do this consistently. Example: "те, кто Христовы, распяли плоть со страстями" → "… (Гал. 5:24)".
- For partial biblical quotes present in the transcription: complete the quote and add the proper reference.
- Example: "Павел пишет, что Христос смирился" → "апостол Павел пишет: «но уничижил Себя Самого, приняв образ раба» (Флп. 2:7)".
- Use Синодальный перевод (Synodal translation) for Bible quotes when you include the quote text.
- DO NOT include the full text of the main sermon verse inside the thought. You MAY still append its reference if the thought alludes to it (reference allowed, verse text not allowed).
- If the user references a Bible story, add the exact verse(s) for the key line(s) where appropriate.
- Never fabricate references: only add when you are confident about the verse. If unsure, omit the reference.

// 4. TAGGING RULES
- Only use tags from the provided list in userMessage
- Assign tags based on content type and sermon structure position
- Common section tags: "Вступление", "Основная часть", "Заключение"

// 5. MEANING PRESERVATION CHECK
- Critically evaluate if the generated 'formattedText' accurately preserves the core meaning and intent of the original 'Транскрипция'.
- Set 'meaningPreserved' to true ONLY if the meaning is accurately reflected.
- Set 'meaningPreserved' to false if the meaning has drifted, been significantly altered, or if the generated text is irrelevant/nonsensical based on rule #1.

// 6. RESPONSE FORMAT
Always return a JSON object with:
- "originalText": The original, unmodified 'Транскрипция' text.
- "formattedText": Edited transcription text in Russian (or original if irrelevant as per rule #1, matching 'originalText' in that case). If enumerations are present, format them as an ordered list with line breaks as described in 2a.
- "tags": Array of applicable tags (only from available tags list)
- "meaningPreserved": boolean (true if meaning is preserved, false otherwise)

Return only the JSON object, no explanations.
